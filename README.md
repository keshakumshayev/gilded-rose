I'm refactoring the gilded rose kata!

First I wrote tests to make sure the code was working & then went on to refactor.

The update_quality method was a bit messy to my eye and I decided to rewrite it from scratch instead of attempting to modify it bit by bit.
I made a diagram of the behaviour of different items and wrote a method focused on each individual item that way things were grouped and less confusing.
